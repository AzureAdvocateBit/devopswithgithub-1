## Workshop: DevOps with GitHub on Azure

### Exercise 2 â€“ Run and test the local code in VS Code 
 - Opening the local folder 
 - Reviewing the code 
 - Running and testing the code
 - Reviewing VS Code Git/GitHub 


### Build and run the web application
Now that you have the web application, you can build and run it locally.

In Visual Studio Code, choose the build icon (the triangle and bug on the left), then 


> .NET Core projects typically come with two build configurations: Debug and Release. Debug builds aren't optimized for performance. They make it easier for you to trace through your program and troubleshoot issues. Here we choose the Release configuration just to see the web app in action.


### Verify that the application is running
In development mode, the Sample App is configured to run on port 5000.

From a new browser tab, navigate to http://localhost:5000 to see the running application.
