# Workshop: GitHub on Azure

>DevOps is great, if you have the people, processes and tools to support it.  In this session Iâ€™ll highlight the easiest ways for developers to work with their IT organizations and partners to deliver their code to the cloud using GitHub, including the best ways to reliably make updates and maintain production cloud code. The focus is on real-world examples using command line tools, free tools including GitHub Actions, and free SDKs and tools available on GitHub.
